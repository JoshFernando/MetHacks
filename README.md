ü§ñ What it does

Ripply is an innovative project that transforms how users interact with Ripple and manage their NFTs.
It provides an alternative chatbot UI that enables users to make transactions, view details, and mint NFTs through chat, making the process accessible and straightforward for everyone.
Ripply leverages advanced AI and natural language processing technologies, such as Cohere, to accurately understand user queries and provide relevant information or options.
The chatbot's functionality is powered by the Ripple API, which enables it to access and display user account information, buy and sell orders for NFTs, and current transaction fees.
The integration of Cohere API enhances the overall user experience by determining the best option that matches the user's response.
Ripply promotes financial inclusion by making digital assets more accessible and user-friendly, especially for those with limited experience in cryptocurrencies.

üß† How we built it

Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Language Models like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Cohere to interpret user input and generate appropriate responses.
Machine Learning algorithms to continuously improve the chatbot's understanding of user queries and responses over time.
Integration with the XRP Ledger (XRPL) using Ripple API to facilitate secure transactions and manage NFTs. XRP Wallets support to allow users to manage their Ripple assets directly through the chatbot interface while maintaining security and privacy.
HTML and CSS for the frontend design of Ripply, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
Voiceflow integration for speech-to-text capabilities, catering to users who prefer verbal communication or have difficulty typing.
Google Cloud was used for hosting the chatbot and storing user data securely, providing high availability and performance.
The development process involved implementing and integrating the sell offer API and Cohere's API to ensure accurate interpretation of user queries.
Ripply allows users to effortlessly manage their Ripple transactions, view NFT details, and mint new NFTs through the chat interface, making it a groundbreaking solution in the world of cryptocurrencies and NFTs.

üß© Challenges we ran into

Team availability: Two of our team members had to leave the hackathon midway due to unforeseen circumstances. One had work commitments, while the other fell ill. This reduction in manpower put additional pressure on the remaining members to distribute tasks and responsibilities effectively.
Learning from scratch: None of our team members had prior experience with all the languages, frameworks, and technologies we used for this project. We had to learn everything from scratch, often relying on online resources and documentation to quickly acquire the necessary skills. This steep learning curve added to the challenge but also fueled our passion to explore new areas and grow as developers.
Risk-taking and innovation: To make Ripply stand out, we decided to push the boundaries and take risks, incorporating cutting-edge technologies such as NLP, LLM, and blockchain. This approach came with its own set of challenges, as we had to rapidly familiarize ourselves with these technologies and integrate them successfully into our project. This willingness to go above and beyond demonstrated our team's commitment to innovation.
Minting NFTs: We encountered problems while attempting to mint NFTs using the API. Resolving these issues required extensive troubleshooting, debugging, and refining of our codebase. These setbacks, however, provided valuable learning experiences and ultimately strengthened our understanding of the NFT minting process on the XRP Ledger.
Despite these challenges, our team persevered and managed to create a groundbreaking chatbot UI for Ripple. We believe that overcoming these obstacles has made us stronger as a team and has ultimately contributed to the success of Ripply.
